[PeteOpenGL2Tweak v2.3 Changelog](http://www.emucr.com):  
Deposterize filter - useful for games with heavy dithering like Silent Hill.  
Fixes & optimizations in Texture Cache.  
Slice option replaced with BatchSize for more even parallel workload.  
Changed some default settings.  
  
About BatchSize:  
This value represents number of texels (texture pixels) to be processed at once ie. higher value - less parallel processing, lower value - more parallel processing.  
So old slice option was number of batches, and new option is a size of single batch.  
Making batch size constant and calculating slice sizes at run-time make workload more even because different textures now have different slice count.

[MESS Git Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
\* Play\_2: small correction (nw)  
\* add NFS Underground System Recovery CD dump (nw)  
\* Jolly Card (Austrian, set 2): Added specs... \[Roberto Fresca, Team Europe\]  
\* Jolly Card (Austrian, set 2): Added GAL16V8S dump (Team Europe, caius)  
\* Added support for MPU4 layouts for games beginning with 'a', based on MFME2MAME conversion. CHR protection data is still not hooked up for many of these sets, so lamping behaviour is incorrect.  
\* Fixed rom size in s80btest.  
\* update comments (nw)  
\* dotrikun: update prev commit  
\* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/mamedev/mame  
\* Merge pull request #1277 from superctr/technodr  
Make Techno Drive working, fix H8 ADC inputs.  
\* Make Techno Drive working  
The game previously displayed a 'COIN ERROR' at bootup. Fixed this by  
patching the sub CPU program (not the best fix maybe but I hope it will  
work for now).  
The contents of 'th1fl3l.12' and 'th1fl3u.13' appeared to have been  
swapped. Swapped the filenames and placed them at the proper memory  
location (0x1800000) and the game no longer crashes at the Namco logo.  
Played through the game a few times and it seems to be fully working  
now.  
\* Change endianness of H8 ADC register  
This was broken in a rewrite a long time ago, breaking the controls in  
some Namco System 12 (and probably 23) games.  
This commit improves controls in golgo13, g13knd and technodr.  
\* Merge pull request #1270 from PressStartandSelect/master  
Document 3 diagnostic menu bugs in the Vii's BIOS  
\* document 3 diagnostic menu bugs  
from https://tcrf.net/Vii  
\* Reverted last commit.  
\* Added vgmplay to mess build.  
\* Pinball fix from my previous commit (nw)  
\* alto2: Refactor videotiming + use attoseconds\_t  
Use MAME's type attoseconds\_t and handle the timing accus in  
attoseconds instead of nanoseconds.  
Try to solve the video timing issues by using an emu\_timer running  
at the field rate of 60Hz, which the video state machine synchronizes to.  
\* Merge pull request #1275 from johnparker007/master  
Update regenerated Maygay layouts - all now initialise ok (nw)  
\* Update regenerated Maygay layouts - all now initialise ok  
\* dotrikun: try another method for video timing

\* -vgmplay.cpp: Added POKEY support, and rebalanced audio. \[Ryan Holtz\]  
\* aica: add ADPCM diff value clamp based on encoder research \[kode54, MetalliC\]  
if there is known issues with YMZ280B it might be worth try to same decoder there

fix more softlist regressions  
\* Changing device\_image\_interface::determine\_open\_plan() to not support creating an image unless device\_image\_interface::create() is used  
I'm somewhat surprised that this has not bit us until now. The implication of how it used to work is that device\_image\_interface::load() could actually create images; it is hard to eliminate the possibility that something might be incorrectly relying on this behavior. I've determined that this isn't the case for imgcntrl.cpp and floppycntrl.cpp  
\* Now reporting Windows ERROR\_INVALID\_NAME as osd\_file::error::NOT\_FOUND

WiiMC-SS

WiiMC-SS is a personal version of WiiMC. [WiiMC](http://www.emucr.com) is an open source media player for the [Nintendo Wii](http://www.emucr.com). The GUI is powered by libwiigui.<a name="more"></a>

<table style="border:1px solid #C0C0C0;width:550;padding:10px;margin-left:20px;"><tr><td>I allocated more memory for the GUI, and added some new things:  
  
-Enabled ADX audio decoding  
  
I mean this is a gaming console so why not support game music formats?  
A limitation in ffmpeg prevents proper decoding of 48000Hz ADX files. (NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams)  
Tested ADX files from TWEWY (16364Hz), Sonic Unleashed (32000Hz), and ADX files made with adxencd.  
Sonic Gems also uses 48000Hz, yet they play fine.  
  
-GameCube controller support  
Every button from the wiimote (Form Baton) is currently mapped.  
Please note that there are still some things that require the pointer.  
  
-The option to disable the H.264 deblock filter on a per video basis  
  
To disable simply change the extension of your video to ".dash".  
Disabling this increases decoding speed a lot, but decreases visual quality, however depending on the video you can get away with it quite well. Keep in mind that the Netflix app for Wii does this for both main and baseline profiles.  
  
-After testing hour-long youtube videos I found out framedropping breaks them so any video with the ".webm" extension will now skip framedropping.  
  
-Added an option to enable the volume normalizer audio filter.  
-Added an option to always zoom videos to 4:3 ratio. (H zoom should be ~133%)  
-Added an option to enable deflicker, 480i and 480p supported.  
To use these options, start WiiMC-SS, exit, open settings.xml and you will see three new entries in the videos section. Their value will default to "0", change it to "1" to enable.  
Or set it to "2" to enable volnorm method 2.  
  
-240p mode. To use this video mode, you must load WiiMC-SS with arguments:  
One argument = NTSC  
Two arguments = PAL  
Three arguments = PAL-M</td></tr></table>

GameEnd v0.8 Beta
-----------------

[![EmuCR: GameEnd](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ibOXsCLOQDlcedeGWQz9qCk7WBUFdxj4zmLRXypc7yQgSPSJFFY9U6H13gTuL6n0qEDvaXwIEq9lSF2ZAyDOF0UR4b4kppEbUw-q_qJ3h3Uh3eE=s0-d "EmuCR: GameEnd")](http://www.emucr.com)GameEnd v0.8 Beta is released. GameEnd is an Emulation & Gaming Frontend for Windows (more platforms will be supported down the line). It supports any Emulator and your PC and Steam Games too. It's also 100% free and open source (the source code will be dropping soon).<a name="more"></a>  
  
Notes:  
\* Auto download of metadata when importing your games doesn’t actually work at the moment. However, you can automatically download metadata for your game once imported. Go to your game list, right click a game and choose “edit”. You’ll see an option in the popup wizard to import metadata either from the scraper, or your hard-drive.  
\* User settings don’t save currently. Such as the zoom level. Your imported games and emulators will of course save.  
\* There may be bugs, there probably is. I feel it’s quite stable at present however. Based on feedback from our private testing group.  
\* If a platform is missing from the available platform options when importing a game, you need to go to Data/Platforms.json and add an entry for the said platform. This is only a temporary measure. The ability to add platforms via the wizard will be added shortly.  
\* Source code will be released either shortly, or after GameEnd is out of beta.  
\* If you’re a programmer, graphics designer or video creator and want to contribute to GameEnd, contact us on our forums or discord. There’s plenty of work to go around   
\* Some other things I may have forgotten.  
  
[GameEnd v0.8 Beta Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
The project is in beta state. It is a little rough around the edges in certain areas, but certainly usable.

It was designed and commissioned by John IV as a familiar feeling alternative to [MAMEUI](http://www.emucr.com). It has a narrow and particular feature-set, is keyboard driven, and utilises many of the navigation and short cuts of [MAMEUI](http://www.emucr.com).

[IV/Play](http://www.emucr.com) is decoupled from setting [MAME](http://www.emucr.com) options directly in an effort to future proof against the continual core changes that impact [MAMEUI](http://www.emucr.com).<a name="more"></a>

This is a port of VirtuaNES to 3DS as an alternative to existing NES emulators. It used to be considered one of the best emulators before FCE and Nestopia, and it runs quite fast for lower spec-ed computers (at the cost of some emulation accuracy). But because of that, the Old 3DS / 2DS is able to benefit from this fast running emulator core. This runs full speed on an old 3DS / 2DS with support for tonnes of mappers. Although it doesn't support every single mapper, the library of games that can run on this are probably fairly huge already.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[VirtuaNES for 3DS Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
\- Fixed bug in MMC5 mapper that was causing Castlevania 3's graphics to corrupt.   
\- Optimized rendering to 16-bit buffer to reduce cache misses, and minor optimizations for MMC5 rendering.   
\- Fixed occassional crashing bug when loading a ROM.

Lunar SNES v1.01
----------------

[Lunar SNES v1.01](http://www.emucr.com) is released. [Lunar SNES](http://www.emucr.com) is an emulator for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It's a Windows 7 program with an easy to use interface. Rather than relying on complicated external mappings, Lunar SNES instead detects all it needs to from ROM images, because this information is always accurate ^^. This means you can just load your games and play them right away. No foltainers! No BIOSes! Featuring high-level emulation of DSP chips by Alcaro and Twinaphex, Lunar SNES's compatibility is exactly the same as traditional emulators such as ZSNES. In addition, there is no Manifest Viewer. Unless you type “Chelsea” on the main window.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[Lunar SNES v1.01 changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
-Added headerless ROM support. It was supported all along, just  
deliberately disabled for April Fools.  
-Replaced the high-level DSP emulation with low-level emulation.

A VBA-M port for Nintendo Switch. It's based of the libretro port(the actual emulator) and 3DSGBA(the GUI, although heavily refactored). After porting 3DSGBA(which often crashed probably because of a huge amount of memory leaks), I tried porting mGBA which ran not so well. That's why I decided to experiment with a lighter less accurate emulator, which lead to this port.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[Features](http://www.emucr.com)  
\* Quite high compability(haven't tried many games)  
\* Save games and save states

EmulationStation
----------------

[![EmuCR: EmulationStation](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WahEevpvQgg/U-zEkNhGUzI/AAAAAAAAOrY/e_n1LhSxXKo/s1600/logo_es.png "EmuCR: EmulationStation")](https://www.emucr.com)[EmulationStation (2018/02/04)](https://www.emucr.com) is released. [EmulationStation](http://www.emucr.com) is a graphical and themeable emulator front-end that allows you to access all your favorite games in one place, even without a keyboard!<a name="more"></a>  
  
[Some of the new features:](https://www.emucr.com)  
A built-in, graphical scraper system. No more using an external Python script. Automatically download full names, box art, descriptions, release dates, and optionally ratings. You can scrape several systems at once, or just individual games.  
A built-in, graphical metadata editor. No more editing XML files by hand. Press the “Select” button in the game list and choose “EDIT THIS GAME’S METADATA” to open it. You can scrape metadata from the editor, too.  
The old theming system has been completely replaced. The new system is more flexible, but still simple, and much more consistent.  
There’s an <include> tag now! No more defining fonts/sounds by hand across 30 systems!  
Textlists support left, center, and right alignments, as well as horizontal margins. You can also control line spacing.  
Images can now be in SVG format (vector graphics), so they look good at any resolution.  
You can now add static text wherever you want.  
Themes are now distributed as sets. You can change the current set within EmulationStation itself, without even restarting the program.  
Read THEMES.md for examples and more information!  
A new “System Select” screen, featuring the logos for all your systems in a carousel. Themable, of course.  
A new set of themes done by Nils, for every platform RetroPie supports and more! Each system has a beautiful vector logo!  
The old menu (when you press “start”) has been completely redone, in both functionality and style. Along with pretty much every piece of UI.  
The input configuration system has been revamped. In addition to looking much nicer, it is now easy to add new controllers after the initial configuration: just select “CONFIGURE INPUT” from the main menu.  
An on-screen help system, that shows what buttons do what things.  
A built-in settings menu that lets you change:  
The screensaver timeout  
The screensaver behavior (dim vs. completely black screen)  
Toggle framerate display  
Toggle on-screen help display  
Toggle left/right changing the system in the game list view (forcing you to use the new system select carousel); useful for those with analog sticks.  
The screen transition style (“fade” or “slide”)  
The current theme set  
The global system volume (on the Operating System level)  
When scrolling in really long game lists, after a few seconds, the screen will dim and display the first 2 letters of where the cursor is, Steam Big Picture style.  
Gamelist.xmls now support relative paths, so it should be possible to transfer them between computers and make portable installations.  
EmulationStation no longer closes immediately if you launch it without es\_systems.cfg set up properly. It now shows an in-program message box explaining the error.  
Upgraded from SDL1.2 to SDL2 with the Raspberry Pi video driver. No more “white dot” when ES is starting.  
es\_systems.cfg is now in XML, to be consistent with every other configuration file.  
An actual website: http://www.emulationstation.org. Huge thanks to Nils for design suggestions/tweaks, as usual. It includes a detailed “Getting Started” page.  
More!

[NestopiaX](http://www.emucr.com) is a [NES emulator](http://www.emucr.com) for the [XBOX](http://www.emucr.com). This is a port of the pc [NES](http://www.emucr.com) emu nestopia and is now the best [NES](http://www.emucr.com) emu on [XBOX](http://www.emucr.com). It also plays the famicom disc system games at full framerate.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[NestopiaX v2.2 Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)

<table style="border:1px solid #C0C0C0;width:550;padding:10px;margin-left:20px;"><tr><td>This is a another HUGE core and compatibility update to nestopiax which also adds more gui options! Taken straight from the readme:  
  
1.) Added the ability to set the ram power on state of the emulated NES. This affects games like River City Ransom's start up enemies and other games. By default a real NES used random values to flush into ram on startup. Nestopia still defaults to 0XFF. To toggle the settings, go into general options while in game and set the state to random and reset to hard and Nestopia will flush ram like a real NES did after resetting.  
  
2.) Added the option to emulate the famicom Mic. Most famicom and FDS games did not utilize the mic but some games like the zelda FDS version utilized the mic to kill pols voice. The option can be found in controller options in general settings. You can set the simulation of the noise of the mic to the xbox dpad. Press it repeatedly to simulate sound into the mic.  
  
3.) Added support for the Bandai Hypershot for games like space shadow. It is integrated with the lightgun support, so set controller 1 to gamepad and controller 2 to lightgun. Button a on the xbox dpad is to shoot, and B moves the character forward after killing an alien. Button b also throws a grenade while fighting an alien. This will be cleaned up in the future but for now, Bandai Hypershot games are now playable on xbox.  
  
Note: Lightgun games are not compatible with the NTSC filter.  
  
4.) Correct and accurate emulation of the MC-ACC mapper. Games like Mickeys safari in letterland and others now play accurately.  
  
5.) Lutter FDS Was freezing, fixed!  
  
6.) Blaster master pimp your ride was not working correctly, FIXED!  
  
7.) Core and Xbox side code cleanup  
  
8.) Added partial support for mapper 168 - Racermate Challenge II  
  
9.) Added support for mapper 162 - Zelda Triforce of the gods pirate and translation now work  
  
10.) Added support for Board KS-7031 Dracula II FDS conversion works (perilsensitive)  
  
11.) Added support for mapper 190 - Magic Kid goo goo now works  
  
12.) Added support for Kaiser unif board 7012 Zanac FDS conversion  
  
13.) Added support for Highway Star FDS conversion  
  
14.) Fixed Resident Evil Nes translation (now saves and plays correctly)  
  
15.) Added support for Getsufuu Maden Translation  
  
15.) Updated the Database.xml file with TONS of new games and fixes. Please overwrite the current database.xml with the new one. The following games now work:  
  
1.)B-Wings (Eng-Trans, Stardust Crusaders, 1.0)  
2.)Added entry for scrambled screen on some Arkanoid II roms  
3.)Crisis force (sample prototype)  
4.)FIFA International 2 '96  
5.)Crisis Force (Eng-Trans, Stardust Crusaders, 1.0)

RetroArch v1.7.4

[![EmuCR: RetroArch  ](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KcWLAimovGY/T8xj538A-KI/AAAAAAAAEQY/BGO1Lza8G8w/s1600/msq8E.png "EmuCR: RetroArch ")](http://www.emucr.com)[RetroArch v1.7.4](http://www.emucr.com) is released. [RetroArch](http://www.emucr.com) is a multi-system emulator for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and \*BSD. It is formerly known as SSNES. Its design and background is quite different than most other emulators as RetroArch does not implement an emulation core itself. RetroArch talks to libretro, a generic emulator core API. This means that RetroArch is core agnostic, and it does not care which emulator core is running.<a name="more"></a>  
  
Currently there are libretro implementations for systems such as SNES, NES, GBA, GB/GBC, Genesis, and even arcade games (Final Burn Alpha).  
  
libretro isn't only usable for emulators. A preliminary port of an open source reimplementation of Cave Story has been ported to libretro as well.  
  
RetroArch believes in modularity. The application itself is a command-line driven application suitable for HTPC and/or headless use. There also exists a GUI frontend for RetroArch, supporting every single config option available in RetroArch.

[Visual PinMAME v3.1 changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
Version 3.1 (July 29th, 2018) - "Flippin' fast"  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
\*\*\* CORE/CPU \*\*\*  
Fix wrong gain/volume of voices/sound effects in Sound Mode 1 (i.e. builtin alternate sound file support)  
Further improve M114 sound core (Mr. Game)  
Add save credits support for Bow & Arrow  
Fix neverending sounds on LTD system 4 games, added sound support for Cowboy Eight Ball and Zephy  
Fix S.A.M. PulseSolState (needed for mech) and bug in Family Guy mini-playfield lights and move the (non-modulated) LED outputs in Tron LE that occupied columns 8 and 9 so far (i.e. disabling the start button lamps) to cols 11 and 12  
Implement 'fast flips' support for some S.A.M. games: Recommended table implementation is to use direct/fast flipper flips when solenoid 33 is on, but to respond to the standard flipper solenoids when 33 is off  
 (acd\_168h, acd\_170, acd\_170h, avr\_200, avs\_170, bbh\_170, bdk\_294, csi\_240, fg\_1200, ij4\_210, im\_183ve, mt\_145h, mtl\_170h, nba\_802, potc\_600, rsn\_110h, shr\_141, smanve\_101, st\_161h, tf\_180, tf\_180h, trn\_174h, twd\_160, twd\_160h, twenty4\_150, wof\_500, wpt\_140a, xmn\_151h)  
Implement proper 'fast flips' support for some WPC-S games: Still uses solenoid 31  
 (WHO Dunnit)  
Implement 'fast flips' support for most WPC-95 games: Takes over solenoid 31, so is compatible with the existing VP core scribts UseSolenoids=2 implementation  
 (Attack from Mars, Cactus Canyon, Champion Pub, Cirqus Voltaire, Congo, Fish Tales, Junk Yard, Medieval Madness, Monster Bash, NBA Fastbreak, No Good Go(l)fers, Safe Cracker, Scared Stiff, Tales of the Arabian Nights)  
Implement 'fast flips' support for most Whitestar games: Uses solenoid 15  
 (apollo13, austin, Dale Jr., Elvis, godzilla, Grand Prix, harl\_a30, hirolcas, id4, jplstw22, Lord of the Rings, lostspc, monopoly, NASCAR, nfl, playboys, rctycn, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, shrkysht, simpprty, Sopranos, spacejam, sprk\_103, startrp2, strikext, strxt\_uk, swtril43, term3, twst\_405, vipr\_102, xfiles)  
Implement 'fast flips' support for most Capcom games: Uses solenoid 51  
 (abv106, bbb109, bsv103, ffv104, Kingpin, Pinball Magic)  
Fix some (unfortunately not all) AT91 JIT crashes (i.e. S.A.M. and Whitestar II)  
Fix GameOn solenoid instability when ModSol is in use  
 This should remove the need for tweaks in tables that use the VPMModSol=1 flag (a multi-threading problem - the code temporarily was juggling solenoids 28-32 (as they get moved to 37+ in some cases), but VPM can be used to read the values while the calculation was still updating solenoids)  
Cleanup, unify and clarify some of the game names/variants  
Fixed Cheap Squeak sound ROM loading for 8K sized ROMs, Space Hawks's and Dark Shadow's original sound ROMs are working now  
Un-cloned some Bell games (different gameplay, different solenoid assignment, missing aux lamps etc.)

WineD3D v3.14
-------------

[WineD3D v3.14](http://www.emucr.com) is relesaed. WineD3D For Windows is a DirectX 1-11 to OpenGL wrapper based on WineD3D, which is an almost full implementation of DirectX used in Wine. Even if Windows supports DirectX natively, using WineD3D can enhance backwards compatiblity with older games, especially on Windows 8 and newer that don't support 16 bit screen modes. Another possible use is to emulate unsupported versions of DirectX, or porting DirectX applications to OpenGL without having to rewrite the rendering code.<a name="more"></a>

[XBoyAdvance v25 Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
\* Updated to madmab edition interface CFv1b35. See "Interface Changelog.txt"  
\* Changes to the screenshot code to account for new directory layout when using "Extras menu" screenshot options.  
\* Just a refresher (this was already present in last version) Frameskip is set to 0 if a gameboy or gameboy color game is selected (file extension .gb, .gbc, .cbg, .sgb). This will only apply to games without configurations. On games with configurations you have to manually set the framerate to 0.  
\* Frameskip is set to 1 for GBA games thanks to Tabajara's INTEL optimizations! See below. Not all games quite at 100%, but close! This will only apply to games without configurations. On games with configurations you have to manually set the framerate to 0.  
\* Frameskip in default game configuration is overriden by above settings. If you have a problem game (slow) just set the frameskip for it individually.  
\* INTEL optimizations by Tabajara. Here are a few examples of improvements you will see below

Some of you may have noticed that Olympian Magic has seen no updates for over 3 weeks. I didn't put it on hiatus just for the sake of taking a break. No, the reason it went on hiatus is this project: bsnes-mcfly. This is a port of the Qt GUI from bsnes v073 to higan v106. In development versions up to v106, it was previously known as “bsnes-classic” in an attempt to replace AWJ's fork also named “bsnes-classic”. However, AWJ has shown that bsnes-classic is still alive, so this project had to be renamed.<a name="more"></a>

[ZEsarUX changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
Yes, this is the 5th Anniversary edition, so, 5 years have passed since version 0.1: 24th September 2013 :))  
  
Here is the changelog for version 7.1:  
  
Added ACB/ABC/BAC/Custom AY Stereo emulation  
Added joystick action to change emulated joystick type: Sinclair, Kempston, etc  
Added Basic viewer for .bas basic files (plain ascii or Basic Spectrum data with tokens), .baszx80 (Basic ZX80 with tokens), .baszx81 (Basic ZX81 with tokens), Z88 basic files with tokens  
Added Sped format file viewer  
Added ZXUno DMA emulation. Added some dma demos to zxuno.mmc image  
Added TBBlue/DataGear/MB02 DMA emulation  
Added TBBlue Multiface emulation  
Added TBBlue Debug menu: Sprite navigator, Video layers, Video info  
Added setting to deny turbo mode on TBBlue, useful on slow machines  
Added Beeper Piano Menu  
Added new Z80 TBBlue opcodes and deleted obsolete ones  
Added setting to change Kempston Mouse sensitivity  
Added menu item to create autoconfig files (.config)  
Added setting --random-r-register to generate random value for R register on every cold start, instead of the normal 0 value. Useful to avoid same R register in the start of games, when they use that register as a random value  
Added OSD Adventure Text Keyboard, useful for having typical words on Adventure Text Games (and of course any other kind of games and programs)  
Added tool to export vocabulary from a PAWS/QUILL/GAC game to a list of words in the OSD Adventure Text Keyboard  
Added new versions of my Sped compiler:  
\*Sped52en: English translation by Tim Gilberts, based on Sped52. In Sped format  
\*Sped53: Fixed bug from Sped52 (object code was always saved from 49152), based on Sped52. Spanish Version. In Sped format  
\*Sped53en: Fixed bug from Sped52 + English translation + minor changes in Spanish version by Tim Gilberts, based on Sped52en and Sped53. English and Spanish Version. In Sped format  
\*Sped54en: Fixed bug from Sped52 + English translation by Tim Gilberts, based on Sped52en, Sped53 and Sped54en. English Version. In plain text format  
Sped53en is also included in the Spectrum Next by default :)  
  
Improved debugger:  
\*Now you can use every register, variable, number on any position of a condition (left, right), so the following breakpoint conditions are now valid:  
32768>PC  
HL=DE  
3=PC  
DE>IX  
etc...  
\*Optimized debugger so common conditions like PC=X, MRA=X or MWA=X use lots of less cpu than before  
\*Added new kind of breakpoints, "memory breakpoints", which behave like MRA and MWA conditions but a lot faster than them  
\*Added bitwise operators AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^) when using registers/variables breakpoints/watches  
\*Breakpoints actions do not reset keyboard  
\*New pseudo variables:  
\*\*OUTFIRED: returns 1 if last Z80 opcode was an OUT operation  
\*\*INFIRED: returns 1 if last Z80 opcode was an IN operation  
\*\*INTFIRED: returns 1 when an interrupt has been generated  
  
Improved hexdump menu (called now "Hexadecimal Editor"): now you can edit memory and copy zones of memory  
Improved my Cursor Draw program: now you can use kempston mouse. Load cursordr\_mouse.tap instead of cursordr.tap  
Improved file converter: tzx to tap, tap to tzx  
Improved TBBlue video display cpu usage: 3% less cpu in my machine, on a compilation without optimization (O2)  
  
Improved menu:  
  
menu windows: now can have more lines than 22, doing scroll  
now you can write any ascii character on the menu  
added support to show some unicode (utf8) characters on menu  
now you can use binary numbers on expressions (suffix %)  
you can now scroll with mouse on windows with text contents and file selector menus, by clicking the right progress symbol (\*) or the arrows  
now you can move cursor up/down with mouse on windows with text contents and file selector by clicking new arrow buttons  
new file expander on file selector menu, using space key, for the following file types : .tap, .tzx, .dsk, .trd, .mdf, .hdf, .P, .O, Z88 Cards (.epr, .eprom, .flash)  
Improved native snapshot format (ZSF):  
  
Added divmmc/divide state save  
Fixed autoload tape on TBBlue  
Fixed bug when smartload and selecting an unknown file type: if you cancel it, the inserted tape was modified  
Fixed bug reading extension on files with no extension  
Fixed bug reading AY registers: unused bits for registers are set to 0  
  
Fixed bugs on esxdos handler:  
\*readdir call was incrementing PC register when there were no more files  
\*added ESXDOS\_MODE\_CREAT\_TRUNC mode when opening files  
\*BCDE was not returning from a f\_seek call  
\*fixed mode OPEN\_CREAT|WRITE which has appending data after a seek instead of overwriting  
\*added f\_stat,f\_unlink,f\_rename,m\_drive\_info,f\_sync calls  
\*fixed loading help screen on esxdos nmi handler  
\*fixed loading esxdos files with plus3dos header  
  
Fixed Multiface Three emulation  
Fixed text viewer, hex viewer showing some special characters ~ | ^

Virtual \]\[ v8.6
-----------------

[![EmuCR:Virtual ][](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hu9viNKnQdk/W8M1JrrDmII/AAAAAAAAWzo/iVSiqcLlECM6x9CyAwzkCy4kiWEdJuaKwCLcBGAs/s320/icon_256x256.png "EmuCR: Virtual ][")](http://www.emucr.com)[Virtual \]\[ v8.6](http://www.emucr.com) is released. [Virtual](http://www.emucr.com) is a commercial Apple II [emulator](http://www.emucr.com) for Mac OS. [Virtual \]\[](http://www.emucr.com) lets you play the old Apple games, because it supports all graphics modes, lets you control the game paddles with a USB game pad or mouse and emulates the internal speaker. When you want to temporarily interrupt gameplay, Virtual \]\[ allows you to save the entire virtual machine, and continue later on from where you left off.<a name="more"></a>  
  
But [Virtual \]\[](http://www.emucr.com) also supports more "serious" software, because it emulates many peripheral devices: floppy disk, hard disk, mouse, serial port, matrix printer, even cassette tape! It also emulates the Z80A processor, allowing you to run the CP/M operating system.  
  
And for the technically inclined: you can configure the machine by "inserting" and "removing" emulated peripheral cards, change the CPU speed, or even install your own emulated character generator ROM. The "Inspector" feature allows you to closely observe the behavior of the emulated machine and debug Apple II programs.  
  
If you have original diskettes and a working Apple II, Virtual \]\[ can help you convert the diskettes to the Mac, even if they are "copy protected".  
  
The program automatically indexes all Apple II disk images on your Mac, so you can find an Apple II file instantly, by entering its name.  
  
You can download an evaluation version and try the program first. If you like the program, you can buy a license and fully enjoy the nostalgic fun of the old Apple \]\[ computer.  
  
Virtual \]\[ requires an Intel Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" or better.  
  
[Virtual \]\[ v8.6Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
\* Added a keyboard shortcut to enter and exit full screen.   
\* The Inspector's instruction trail now also shows the processor cycle count at the start of each instruction.   
\* The instruction trail can now be saved as a tab-separated text file.   
\* Increased the maximum capacity of the instruction trail to 9999999 instructions (a tenfold increase). This is enough to capture roughly 35 to 40 seconds of CPU activity at regular speed. Be aware that saving such a large trail takes some time and results in a big file!   
\* When ejecting a diskette, the disk image was always saved, even if the disk had not been modified. This bug was introduced recently, and has now been corrected; a disk image is only saved if the disk contents have acually been changed.   
\* ProDOS disk images with a ".po" filename extension and a size of 800 KB (or larger) can now be mounted as an OmniDisk, and are also processed by the Spotlight importer.   
\* Disk images with a .nib extension now show up in the disk search window as "custom file system".   
\* Fixed an issue in the SCSI card emulation that could corrupt the "screenhole" memory locations in auxiliary memory, whereas it should have used main memory. In the revised ROM code the screen hole memory isn't used anymore at all.   
\* If a USB or Bluetooth game controller is connected, the option to use the keyboard arrows as a joystick is now disabled. It appeared that the latter option could corrupt the values received from the game controller (even without touching the arrow keys).   
\* Powering up a virtual machine with an OmniDisk resulted in a boot failure if a higher numbered slot contained a card with expansion ROM. This now works as it should.   
\* Changed built-in web links from http to https (for servers that support https).

[![EmuCR: Budford ](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-udEpKbj2kNI/Vhe_FGAeACI/AAAAAAAALUU/lZlpRzxVvVg/s320/Wii_U_logo.svg.png "EmuCR: Budford ")](http://www.emucr.com)[Budford v1.0.118](http://www.emucr.com) is released. Cemu is a great emulator. But it currently only has limited support for per game settings. How many times have you turned on multi-core support for Breath of the Wild then forgotten to set it back to single core before playing Mario Kart with your friends. And we all know how frustring it can be when a new release arrives and your favorite game no longer works. Budford is a configuration management tool for Cemu with a familiar interface for those who have used the Dophin emulator. Budford is not a game launcher, it is designed to work with your favorite game launcher.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[Budford Features:](http://www.emucr.com)  
\* Simple user interface for configuring per game settings.   
\* Budford can support multiple users each with their own save file for each game.   
\* Supports multiple concurrent versions of Cemu. Budford will create a symbolic link to your mlc01\\usr\\title folder.   
\* Can download the latest version of Cemu , Cemu hook and performs all the required setup for you.   
\* Can automatically download the latest graphic packs.   
\* Budford can integrate with your favorite game launcher such as launch box or emulation station, it can even launch straight into the game pad view so you'll never need your keyboard again.   
\* Global settings for audio volume and your preferred graphic pack resolution. (You can override these in your per game settings)   
\* Game ratings and view filters to help you find your favorite games.   
\* Track statistics such as the number of times you have played each game or how long since you last played it.   
\* Easy access short cuts to important Cemu folders such as Shader Cache, Save Folders and Game files. No more searching through log files to find folder names.

You will need freeglut as well as openal-soft to compile the project, it should run on most systems since it is fairly generic C code. Right now most standard GB titles using MBC1, 3 and 5 should work just fine and also save into standard .sav files. You can also listen to .gbs files by dragging them in, changing tracks works by pressing left/right.<a name="more"></a>

[ANESE (Another NES Emulator)](http://www.emucr.com) is a Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator being written for fun and learning. While accuracy is a long-term goal, ANESE’s primary goal is to play some of the more popular titles. As of now, most basic Mappers have been implemented, so popular titles should be working! :smile: ANESE is built with cross-platform in mind, and is regularly built on all major platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux). ANESE doesn’t use any vendor-specific language extensions, and is compiled with strict compiler flags. It is also linted (fairly) regularly. ANESE strives for clean and interesting C++11 code, with an emphasis on readability and maintainability. With that said, performance is important, but it’s not ANESE’s primary focus.<a name="more"></a>

DOSBox-X v0.82.11

[DOSBox-x](http://www.emucr.com) is a branch of [DOSBox](http://www.emucr.com). [DOSBox](http://www.emucr.com) emulates an Intel x86 PC, complete with sound, graphics, mouse, joystick, modem, etc., necessary for running many old MS-DOS games that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Linux and FreeBSD.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[DOSBox-X Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
MinGW HX DOS builds fixed to accept mouse input properly  
even beyond the 640x480 of the original SDL window  
dimensions. HX DOS seems to use the original dimensions  
of the window even if the window is maximized, thus the  
mouse input issue.  
Configuration GUI fixed not to restore (unmaximize)  
the window, it's unnecessary.  
New build scripts for Mac OS X, MinGW, and MinGW HX-DOS,  
under build-scripts in the source tree, to help make  
DOSBox-X releases more timely and consistent.  
MinGW HX DOS builds now use WS\_POPUP style instead  
of WS\_OVERLAPPED to avoid window caption redraw  
glitches when in Windows XP.  
MinGW HX DOS builds fixed to force the SDL window  
maximized at all times. Mapper and Configuration GUI  
interfaces fixed not to call on Windows to SW\_RESTORE  
the window, in order to keep it maximized.  
Steel Gun Nyan PIT/Timer hack revised so that polling  
the timer does not cause an interrupt storm. This  
fixes "God of Thunder" MS-DOS game where entering or  
leaving a house causes the Adlib music to play  
REALLY FAST during the transition effect.  
Dynrec core ported from DOSBox SVN (Daniel-Trevitz)  
Configuration GUI will pack settings closer together  
if the window/screen size is below 800x600.  
Configuration GUI fixed to size dialog boxes as  
large as needed to show all options, to allow tabbing  
between options, to show a focus rectangle on the  
items.  
Configuration GUI top level windows no longer show  
inactive title bar whenever you access a menu.  
About dialog in configuration GUI updated to  
reflect that this is DOSBox-X in 2018, not  
DOSBox in 2014.  
Configuration GUI now works with touchscreens in  
SDL2 builds.  
INT 33h fixed to regard cursor as hidden if hidden  
for at least 100ms, which fixes host cursor flickering  
when running the built-in FreeDOS EDIT.COM program.  
Mouse input and guest pointer integration limited  
to send input only if within the display region or  
within a 10% border around the display region.  
SDL2 tapping the SDL drawn menu bar (on a touch  
screen) no longer triggers mouse click in the  
guest application (bugfix).  
SDL2 Linux/X11 hack, added to compensate for bugs  
in SDL2 v2.0.5 regarding Linux/X11 touchscreen  
events, removed. SDL2 v2.0.9 fixed it.  
Linux/X11 SDL2 builds will now encourage the user  
to update the SDL2 library installation if  
SDL2 library v2.0.5 is installed.  
Fullscreen mode fixed in SDL2 builds.  
Fixed configuration GUI fade out/in effect after  
exiting mapper GUI bug.  
Configuration GUI now available and working in  
SDL2 builds as well as SDL1.  
SDL2 builds now have a working "Fit aspect ratio"  
option.  
SDL1 fullscreen mode fixed to use either the desktop  
size or the desired output size, and fallback to  
non-fullscreen on failure, to fix a segfault that  
would otherwise happen.  
CONFIG -set sdl showmenu= now changes menu visibility.  
CONFIG -set render scaler= fixed to apply changes  
to scaler and force setting, and update menu items,  
instead of ignoring it.  
CONFIG -set render aspect= now keeps menu synchronized  
with setting.

[Emu Loader Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
Fixed  
Commented ROM / DISK entries were added as game files when creating MAME software games lists (softwarename.xml files)  
\- ROM or DISK entries ending with "-->" tag will not be added ("rocnrope" from "msx1\_cart.xml" is one of the affected games)  
\- you must create MAME software list games again to fix this bug (main menu "Arcade", "Create MAME Software Games List")  
Changed  
PDF game manual updates  
\- support for MAME software lists  
\- scan support for a sub-folder "\\manuals\\" added at the end of your selected PDF folder

Removed  
Some code cleanup, mostly commented out and deprecated  
Added  
"Search game" bar in "View Missing ROMs/CHDs" screen (audit results)  
\- the frontend searches the entered string in game title and then game name if title is not a match  
\- it works like the incremental search in the main games list, partial strings supported  
\- you can press ENTER key in the edit box instead of clicking the "search" button  
\- if there's no match, the edit box blinks red

[AppleWin (also known as Apple //e Emulator for Windows)](http://www.emucr.com) is an open source software emulator for running Apple II programs in Microsoft Windows. [AppleWin](http://www.emucr.com) has support for most programs that could run either on the Apple II+ or the Apple IIe. By default, [AppleWin](http://www.emucr.com) emulates the Extended Keyboard IIe (better known as the Platinum IIe) with built-in 80-column text support, 128 kilobytes of RAM, two 5.25-inch floppy disk drives, a joystick, a serial card and 65C02 CPU. <a name="more"></a>[AppleWin](http://www.emucr.com) supports lo-res, hi-res, and double hi-res graphics modes and can emulate both color and monochrome Apple II monitors; later versions of AppleWin also can emulate a television set used as a monitor. Both 40-column and 80-column text is supported.  
  
[AppleWin](http://www.emucr.com) can emulate the Apple II joystick (using the PC's default controller), paddle controllers (using the computer mouse), and can also emulate the Apple II joystick using the PC keyboard. [AppleWin](http://www.emucr.com) can also use the PC speaker to emulate the Apple II's sound if no sound card is available (does not work under NT-based Windows versions). Full screen mode is available through the use of DirectX. Features added to the latest versions of [AppleWin](http://www.emucr.com) include Ethernet support using Uthernet, Mockingboard and Phasor sound card support, SSI263 speech synthesis, hard drive disk images and save states.  
  
[AppleWin v1.28.0.0 Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
– \[Change #357\] Resurrected the AppleWin 1.25 « Color (Standard) » video mode as « Color (RGB Monitor) ».  
This is equivalent to emulating RGB video, ie. a video mode with sharp text and pixels.  
NB. Unlike AppleWin 1.25, this is now cycle-accurate, so demos that synchronise with the video scanner will work correctly.  
– \[Change #603\] Removed support for v1 save-state files.  
Any v1 save-state files should be loaded into AppleWin 1.27, and then re-saved to a v2 save-state file.  
– \[Change #597\] Removed the functionality for CTRL+F10 to reveal the mouse cursor.  
– \[Change #585\] Added a ‘Swap’ HDD button to the Configuration->Input property sheet.  
– \[Bug #608\] Mockingboard’s 6522 TIMER1 wasn’t generating an interrupt quickly enough for Broadside’s detection routine.

AQZ Netplay Input Plugin Git
----------------------------

[![EmuCR: Project 64](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2Zgr0KaePSU/UAu4rz6nMzI/AAAAAAAABZQ/xlOxKKbC8ss/s400/pj64logo.png "EmuCR: Project 64")](https://www.emucr.com/)[AQZ Netplay Input Plugin Git (2019/01/29) for Project64](http://www.emucr.com) is released. [Netplay Input Plugin ](http://www.emucr.com)is a plugin for [ Project64](http://www.emucr.com/search/label/Project64?&max-results=12). It is an input plugin that supports netplay. <a name="more"></a>

<table style="border:1px solid #C0C0C0;width:550;padding:10px;margin-left:20px;"><tr><td>Instructions:   
  
1) Unzip the dll into the Plugin folder.   
  
2) Open Project64 and select AQZ NetPlay as the input plugin.   
  
3) Go to Options, Configure Controller Plugin. Then, select and configure an input plugin to use. (The netplay plugin relies on another input plugin to do the actual work of reading input from the keyboard/controller.) Make sure one and only one controller is plugged in for each player that will be playing locally (at the same computer). To be a spectator, unplug all controllers.   
  
4) Select a game to play. Send the save file for that game to each player you plan to play with. The save file is located in the "Save" folder by default. If each player does not have the exact same save file, the emulators will probably desync. (If I could, I would have the netplay plugin automatically distribute the save file to everyone else, but it is impossible for an input plugin to know where the save files are located.)   
  
5) Open the game. The netplay plugin window will appear. One person will host the server and everyone else will connect to the host.   
  
The host needs to type the "/server port" command in the box at the bottom and hit enter, where "port" is the port number the server will listen on for connections. The port can be any number between 1 and 65535. A message from a firewall may appear. Be sure to click Allow. Also, if the host is behind an NAT (home router), the port will needed to be forwarded.   
  
Everyone else needs to use the command "/connect host port" to connect to the host, where "host" is the IP address of the host and "port" is the port that the host chose to host the server.   
  
(Note: If anyone is using WiFi (excluding spectators), the game may be laggy unless they have a strong signal with low interference. You're better off using an ethernet cable.)   
  
6) Use the "/name name" command to change your name. The name you choose will be remembered next time you play.   
  
7) Use the "/start" command to start the game.   
  
8) Use the "/lag lag" command to change the lag of the game, where "lag" is the number of frames of delay between when you press a button and when that information reaches the game. Choose the lowest number possible. If you set the lag too low, the game will run slow, especially if there is a lot of latency on the connection between the players. If you set the lag too high, the game will be difficult to play. </td></tr></table>

BlastEm v0.6.1
--------------

[BlastEm v0.6.1](http://www.emucr.com) is released. [BlastEm](http://www.emucr.com) has the goal of being an extremely accurate Genesis emulator while still running on relatively modest hardware by using advanced techniques. Currently it meets neither my accuracy nor performance goals, but those goals are pretty high. Speed and accuracy should be sufficient for most purposes. It runs at full speed on an old first generation Intel Atom and can run Sonic 2 at around 600 fps on a Haswell desktop using a single core. To my knowledge, it is the only emulator besides Genesis Plus GX that can properly display the "TITAN 512C FOREVER" portion of Titan's Overdrive demo, and the only emulator besides Exodus that passes all 122 of the tests in Nemesis' VDP FIFO Testing ROM and can properly display "Direct Color DMA" demos.<a name="more"></a>

However, it is not restricted to running only games. In theory, any MS-DOS or PC-DOS (referred to commonly as "DOS") application should run in [DOSBox](http://www.emucr.com), but the emphasis has been on getting DOS games to run smoothly, which means that communication, networking and printer support are still in early development.<a name="more"></a>

The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having quite a lot of CPU power at that time. Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games and demos.

[higan Changelog：](http://www.emucr.com)  
\* Update to v106r85 release.  
  
byuu says:  
  
The bad instruction was due to the instruction before it fetching one  
too many bytes. Didn't notice right away as the disassembler got it  
right.  
  
The register map was incorrect on the active 16-bit flags.  
  
I fixed and improved some other things along those lines. Hooked up some  
basic KnGE (VPU) timings, made it print out VRAM and some of the WRAM  
onto the screen each frame, tried to drive Vblank and Hblank IRQs, but  
... I don't know for sure what vector addresses they belong to.  
  
MAME says "INT4" for Vblank, and says nothing for Hblank. I am wildly  
guessing INT4==SWI 4==0xffff10, but ... I have no idea. I'm also not  
emulating the interrupts properly based on line levels, I'm just firing  
on the 0→1 transitions. Sounds like Vblank is more nuanced too, but I  
guess we'll see.  
  
Emulation is running further along now, even to the point of it  
successfully enabling the KnGE IRQs, but VRAM doesn't appear to get much  
useful stuff written into it yet.  
  
I reverted the nall/primitive changes, so request for testing is I guess  
rescinded, for whatever it was worth.

\* This version is compatible with game states that made on the previous version.  
\* Sorry for the latest versions of My Nes, it was quit a mess, i was focusing on the core and totaly forgot about experience.   
Consider this version as my apology, I tried my best to fix all the issues related to user interface and game play experience.  
I tested this version on both my Computer (mid range pc) and on my potato laptop (some laptop from 2009 lol), i ran My Nes for hours, carefully configured palette, sound, video, menus and even emulation speed to bring the best experience and quality possible.  
I know My Nes is the not the best Emu out there, but the way i see it after this version, it is really cool to play retro with My Nes now !! just relax, plug xbox 360 controller if you have one, run My Nes and Enjoy !! :D

[Nintendulator](http://www.emucr.com) is an open source Win32 [NES emulator](http://www.emucr.com) written in C (plus some assembly optimization). The original goal was to emulate the [NES](http://www.emucr.com) down to its hardware quirks; though it's fallen behind over the years, recent builds have caught up once again and can emulate certain behaviors most other emulators neglect to handle. However, this emulation precision comes at a price - a 1500MHz (estimated) or faster CPU is required to emulate at full speed.<a name="more"></a>  
  
Supported file formats include .[NES](http://www.emucr.com), UNIF, FDS (fwNES format), and NSF. Mappers are handled using external DLLs, complete with extra sound channels for most games which provide them. Other notable features include writing to FDS images (by storing the differences in the SRAM folder), Game Genie support (limited to 3 codes), customizeable controllers (including 4 player), input movie recording and playback (with re-recording), AVI capturing, and a debugger.

[puNES](http://www.emucr.com) is a [NES emulator](http://www.emucr.com). Currently the program supports mappers 0, MMC1, UNROM, CNROM, and the sound is available. It uses the SDL libraries and it works on both Linux and Windows.<a name="more"></a>  
  
[puNES v0.103 Changelog](http://www.emucr.com)  
\- Added support for the UNIF mapper UNIF DREAMTECH01.  
\- Fixed mapper MMC5 and 213.  
\- Added support for NSFe format.  
\- Added OpenBSD support.  
\- Added support for IPS, BPS and XDELTA patches.  
It's possible to patch the ROM through 3 ways:  
  
rename the patch with the same name as the ROM and copy it to the same directory where the ROM is present (example: if "Adventures of Lolo (U) \[!\].nes" is the name of the ROM, rename the patch in "Adventures of Lolo (U) \[!\].ips")  
  
drag it to the emulator window (compressed patches are supported)  
  
apply it via the "Apply Patch" item in the File menu (compressed patches are supported)  
  
If more than one patch is present in the compressed file, it will always be possible to select which one to apply. In order to automatically apply a patch to a ROM, in addition to method 1) it is also possible to create a compressed archive that contains both the ROM and the patch. In this case the name of the ips file isn't important (example : compressed file contain "Adventures of Lolo (U) \[!\].nes" and "adv.ips").  
  
\- Rewritten the UI for the settings.  
\- Added the compatibility of the UI for High DPI.  
\- Rewritten and uniformed GFX stack.  
\- Increased performance by 20%/30%.  
\- Dropped out dependencies from SDL and QT4 libraries.  
\- Now it's necessary that QT5 have compiled with support for SVG (and OpenGL for OpenGL version).  
\- Fixed the management of VSync (when you change this option you need to restart the emulator to apply it correctly).  
\- Added the ability to change shader parameters if supported by the shader.  
\- Added a palette editor.  
\- Added in Video Settings an option to show FPS.  
\- Eliminated a lot of unnecessary code.  
\- Fixed many many bugs and increased the accuracy of emulation.

[yuzu](http://www.emucr.com) is a work-in-progress Nintendo Switch emulator. yuzu is an open-source project, licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). yuzu has been designed with portability in mind, with builds available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The project was started in spring of 2017 by bunnei, one of the original authors of the popular Citra 3DS emulator, to experiment with and research the Nintendo Switch. Due to the similarities between Switch and 3DS, yuzu was developed as a fork of Citra. This means that it uses the same project architecture, and both emulators benefit from shared improvements. During the early months of development, work was done in private, and progress was slow. However, as Switch reverse-engineering and homebrew development became popular, work on yuzu began to take off as well.<a name="more"></a>

zBoy v0.70
----------

[zBoy v0.70](http://www.emucr.com) is released. [zBoy](http://www.emucr.com) is a [multiplatform GameBoy emulator](http://www.emucr.com) that provides a load/save feature, can perform PCX screenshots either manually or automatically (every few seconds) and emulates an internal battery for ROMs that were designed to use one (this allows to use the internal save option provided by such games, remember highest scores, etc).<a name="more"></a>  
  
zBoy supports some additionnal features, too, like intelligent saving of hi-scores for some games that aren't able to save their hi-scores table by themselves because of the lack of a battery-backed RAM on the cartridge, and improving screen's resolution output using graphic algorithms like Scale2x, Scale3x, eagle... Here you can see a comparison between graphic algorithms supported by zBoy. This is also one of the very few GameBoy emulators that provides a 2-gameboys link emulation, which makes it possible to play some games in 2-players mode on a LAN.  
  
zBoy allows to play GameBoy games using a keyboard or a joypad (or both). The emulator is available for Linux, DOS and Windows (but should compile for other systems without much headache as well).  
  
[zBoy v0.70 Changelog:](http://www.emucr.com)  
\- Sound support (can be disabled with --nosound),  
\- Added ZIP support (zBoy detects ZIP archives, tries to load the first file inside),  
\- Adapted code so it compiles fine with -Werror=format-security (thanks to Andrea Musuruane for suggesting that),  
\- Implemented hi-scores retention for Crystal Quest, Flipul, SolarStriker, Tail Gator and Quarth,  
\- Added colorization support for Crystal Quest, Bomb Jack, Sensible Soccer and Prince of Persia,  
\- Fixed joystick support,  
\- Fixed the '--noshowfps' command-line parameter,  
\- Fixed window computation when WINY is less than 7 (fixed scrolling text on intros in Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and Swamp Thing),  
\- Added emulation of incomplete ROM address decoding (fixed several games: WordZap, Blaster Master, Pac-Man special color edition, Turok, Quarth, Zen Intergalactic Ninja),  
\- Complete redesign of the Netplay support, compatibility is significantly higher now: works with Tetris Attack, Tetris Blast, F-1 Race and many others,  
\- Netplay link peering autodetection on LAN ('--netplay auto' or F12 during gameplay).
